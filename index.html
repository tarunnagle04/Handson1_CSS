        <li>CSS describes how HTML are to be displayed on screen , paper or in other media</li><br>
        <li><span id =  "line">Css is not neccessary</span>
            <mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark>It can control the layout of the multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1 class = "red">CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways</h1>
    <ul style=" letter-spacing: 5px">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in the external CSS files. However, <mark>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</mark>, because this is easier to demonstrate and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>When compairing CSS class vs ID , the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID on the other hand , applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>
    <br>
    <p>There is wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elementsto which a style should be applied.</p>
